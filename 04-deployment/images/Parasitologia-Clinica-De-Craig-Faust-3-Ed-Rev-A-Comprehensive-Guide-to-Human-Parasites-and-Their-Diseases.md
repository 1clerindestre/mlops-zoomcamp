## What is Human Parasitology?
 
Human parasitology is the study of parasites that live on or in humans and their interactions with their hosts. Parasites are organisms that depend on another organism (the host) for their survival, usually causing some harm or discomfort to the host. Parasites can be classified into two major groups: protozoa (single-celled organisms) and helminths (worms).
 
Some of the most common human parasites are:
 
- Giardia lamblia: a protozoan that causes diarrhea, abdominal pain and gas.
- Plasmodium spp.: protozoa that cause malaria, a life-threatening disease characterized by fever, chills, headache and anemia.
- Ascaris lumbricoides: a roundworm that can grow up to 35 cm long and live in the small intestine, causing malnutrition, abdominal pain and intestinal obstruction.
- Trichinella spiralis: a roundworm that infects humans through eating undercooked pork or wild game meat, causing muscle pain, fever and inflammation.
- Schistosoma spp.: flatworms that live in the blood vessels of humans, causing schistosomiasis, a chronic disease that can damage the liver, spleen, bladder and intestines.

## Why is Human Parasitology Important?
 
Human parasitology is important for several reasons:

- It affects the health and well-being of millions of people around the world, especially in developing countries where sanitation, hygiene and access to health care are poor.
- It can cause serious complications and co-infections with other diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malnutrition.
- It can have social and economic impacts on individuals and communities, such as reduced productivity, increased poverty and stigma.
- It can provide insights into the evolution, ecology and immunology of host-parasite interactions.
- It can offer opportunities for developing new drugs, vaccines and diagnostic tools against parasitic diseases.
